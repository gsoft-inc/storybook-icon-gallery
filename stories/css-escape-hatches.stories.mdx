# CSS escape hatches

If you want to have fine-grained control over the CSS, all of the Docs components are tagged with class names to make this possible. This is advanced usage: use at your own risk.

The classes follow [Storybook docs CSS escape hatches naming convention](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/docs/docs/theming.md#css-escape-hatches) (e.g. sbdocs sbdocs-ig-*). To see the currently available classes, simply "inspect element" in your browser.
